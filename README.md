# SysAdminScripts
System Admin/System Repair scripts

These scripts currently only support Windows, but scripts for Linux and MacOS are planned. Ideally, in the future, a single set of scripts written in Python or some other cross-platform language might be used. But, for now, the plan is each platform has it's own USB drive.


## Windows
### SETUP
To get started, grab a flash drive that is at least 4GB in size, click [this link to download the setup program](Windows/setup_RepairTools.bat), then click the download button. Afterwards, move it to the flash drive, then run it!

### Usage
Just right click on `autorun.bat`, and click `Run as Administrator`.


## Linux
Linux Development is underway! There is no setup script yet. But, there is already code to check for corrupt files on Debian-based distros

## MacOS
Coming soon!
